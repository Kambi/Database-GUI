# Database-GUI
Purpose of the blood donation database GUI is to simplify communication among blood banks, donors and doctors.

Designed and implemented a data management GUI which interacts with the user and the back-end database for storing and retrieving the data. The user has the capability to create a unique login, add new data, search, delete, and update existing data.

Blood banks have the ability to add doctors to create a login, add donors to access their login information, and reject/accept requests for blood depending on availability and urgency. Doctors can make requests for blood to be sent to a particular blood bank for their patients. They can also view, add and search through their patients if neeeded which includes access to the patient history with disease name and how urgently the patient needs blood. The donors can see how many lives they have saved from their blood donations.
